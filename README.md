Ahead of the Deriv AI Sprint, I researched areas and problems that Deriv prioritizes and came across an interview online of Derek Swift (Head of Client Funding Facilities at Deriv) with Forex News where he highlighted social engineering and off-platform trust manupilation as key risk areas.

Based on that I built FraudLens AI, a cybersecurity and fraud prevention platform designed to address the rapid rise of AI-driven phishing and behavioural scams. 

FraudLens AI delivers a centralized, real-time security solution powered by Groq’s low-latency AI inference technology and multiple advanced AI models. The platform includes a Chat Behaviour Audit and Email Threat Scanner powered by Meta Llama 3.3 70B, which detect trust-building manipulation, phishing indicators, and off-platform scam attempts while generating risk scores mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. The Forensic Document Audit uses Llama 4 Scout to analyse text and images, identifying altered financial receipts, forged bank statements, and manipulated identification documents. The Synthetic Fluency Detector uses Qwen 3 to identify AI-generated scam messages through linguistic and stylistic pattern analysis. Additionally, the platform includes a Governance, Risk, and Compliance Assistant powered by LLaMA 3.3 with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to simplify regulatory requirements and improve cybersecurity awareness.
